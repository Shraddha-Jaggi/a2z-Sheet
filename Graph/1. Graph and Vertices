Given an integer n representing number of vertices. Find out how many undirected graphs (not necessarily connected) can be constructed out of a given n number of vertices.

class Solution {
    static long count(int n) {
    // code here
    long op = (long)Math.pow(2,(n*(n-1)/2));
    return op;

  }
}
